            <h2>Letter for Kirisai</h2>
            <p>Dear Kiri,</p>
            <p>

                I hope you’re doing well! I know you wanted a physical letter, and trust me, I really wanted to send one, but the distance between us makes this a little tricky. Still, I didn’t want that to stop me from writing to you, so here I am, sending you my thoughts in this way.
                
               <br> I heard that you have an exam coming up—don’t stress too much! I know how hardworking and sincere you are, and I have no doubt that you’ll do great. Just stay calm, trust yourself, and do your best. I’m cheering for you from afar!</br>
                
               <br> Also, how’s your cat? I can imagine it curling up next to you while you study, probably giving you that "why are you so busy?" look. And how is your sister and dad? I hope they’re doing well too.</br>
                
                <br>Kiri, you are such a kind and pure-hearted person, and I feel really lucky to have you as a friend. No matter how far we are, I just want you to know that I’ll always be here for you. One day, we will sit together, laugh, and maybe even write letters to each other in person. Until then, take care of yourself, study well, and don’t forget to take little breaks to relax too!

                Sending you lots of love and best wishes!<br> And sorry for the plane crash in myanmar</br></p>
            <p>Yours Boss,</p>
            <p>Pragnesh</p>
